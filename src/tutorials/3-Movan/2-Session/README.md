## Execution

1. Run `main.py` with a argument
    ```bash
    # Make sure your current directory is in this folder
    # Running TensorFlow session without using "with"
    $ python3 main.py 1
    # Running TensorFlow session using "with"
    $ python3 main.py 2
    ```
2. If succeed, you may will the following result
    ```bash
    # Running TensorFlow session without using "with"
    [INFO] Runing TensorFlow session without using with
    [[12]]
    # Running TensorFlow session using "with"
    [INFO] Runing TensorFlow session using with
    [[12]]
    ```
