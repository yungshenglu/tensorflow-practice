# Tutorial 2 - Basic Classification

We are going to train a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. This guide uses `tf.keras`, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.

> This turoial is refer to "[Train your first neural network: basic classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification)".
